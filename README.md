# Greetings

Hello! I am Jari Haapasaari ([mail](mailto:haapjari@gmail.com)), and this is a research tool for my thesis, and my first Go project! 

This is a complete open-source project, which started from my interest to learn `go`. Feel free to `fork`, leave comment, mail me, or copy parts of the code to your own usage. This `README.md` -file contains notes for the project, tasks, and descriptive information of the logic behind the functionality.
